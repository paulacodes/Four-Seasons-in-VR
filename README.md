# Four-Seasons-in-VR
VR representation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, a project done as a final project for the Interactive Computing class I took at NYU in the Fall of 2016.

This VR world is inspired by Vivaldi's Four Seasons. The world consists of a spinning disk on which 4 dancers, each representing a different season, allow a user to switch between Vivaldi's 4 pieces.

The dancers were created by placing 2D images onto planes, and then rotating these planes according to the amplitude of the song at a certain point in time.

Whenever a user selects one of the 4 dancers, the sky changes to an image portraying a certain season and the asset of the spinning disk to an appropriate texture.
